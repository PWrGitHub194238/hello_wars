<b>Hello Wars: TankBlaster</b> is a game resembling popular Bomberman. It consists of game board divided into small tiles and players moving through this board, dropping bombs and firing missiles

<h3>Board tiles</h3>
Each tile can be of different type:
<ul>
    <li><b>Empty tile</b> - nothing is there. Player can safely move through it</li>
    <li>
        <b>
            Regular tile (<img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_regular_tile.png"/>)
        </b> - this is a tile that will get destroyed if a bomb explodes nearby. Players cannot move through this tile and missiles will explode on impact
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>
            Fortified tile (<img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_fortified_tile.png"/>)
        </b> - this is a tile that won't get destroyed by a bomb blast, but will turn into regular tile instead.
        So basically it is a tile with 2 HP. Players cannot move through this tile and missiles will explode on impact
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>
            Indestructible tile (<img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_indestructible_tile.png"/>)
        </b> - this is a tile that won't get destroyed at all. Players cannot move through this tile and missiles will explode on impact
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<h3>Bombs & Missiles</h3>
There are two types of explodables in the game:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>
            Bomb (
            <img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_bomb.png"/>
            )
        </b> - remains in place for 5 rounds and then explodes
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>
            Missile (
            <img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_missile.png"/>
            )
        </b> - Moves in firing direction at constant speed (1 tile/round). Explodes on contact with tiles, map edges, players, bombs and other missiles.
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<h3>Players</h3>
Players are displayed in a form of tanks (<img class="icon" src="tank_blaster_tank.png"/>). They move through game board trying to kill their opponents with bombs and missiles.
<br/>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<h3>Game board</h3>
Game board is a rectangle, usually 15 - 20 tiles wide and 15 - 20 tiles high (configurable via configuration file).
In program it is represented by 2 dimensional array, where first dimension is X position and second is Y position.
<br/>
Example game board:
<br/>
<img src="tank_blaster_example.png"/>
<br/>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h2>Game mechanics</h2>
<h3>Game round</h3>
Game is divided into rounds. Each round consists of several steps performed in strict order:
<ol>
    <li>Increase round number</li>
    <li>Move missiles, for each missile calculate explosions (if there is an impact)</li>
    <li>Decrease bombs timers and calculate explosions (if bomb's timer reaches 0)</li>
    <li>
        Clear explosions. Unlike original Bomberman, explosions are instant, so there is no chance that player will walk into lasting explosion and get killed.
        However, standing on the field that will explode in the next round is of course fatal
    </li>
    <li>Check if there are at least two alive players left and if not, end the game</li>
    <li>
        Ask players for their moves and execute them. The process is sequential, so each player is asked for next move (current board state is provided), then
        the move is executed (if it's valid), and then next player is asked for his next move, etc.
    </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<h3>Movement & locations</h3>
As mentioned before, game board is represented by 2 dimensional array (grid) [X, Y] with X determining horizontal position (or column) and Y vertical position (or row).
There are 4 types of movement directions: Up, Down, Left and Right. Left and Right directions are pretty obvious: they respectively decrease and increase X value.
Up and Down directions are slightly different. <b>Becasuse game board is being rendered from top left corner, the Up movement direction actually decreases Y value and Down movement direction increases it.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Players can safely move through empty tiles. Moving to fields with regular, fortified or indestructible tiles is prohibited (they are blocking tiles, so game will take this as an invalid move and ignore).
Bombs are non blocking, so players can safely stand on tiles with bombs on them (just need to remember to run before bomb explodes).
Missiles are technically non blocking (game will execute the move), but they explode on impact so moving to a field with missile will result in player's death.
<br/>

<h3>Explosions</h3>
Each explodable (bomb or missile) explodes when certain condition is met. For bomb it is timer expiration,
for missile it's collision with another object (map edge, tile, player, bomb or another missile).
<h4>Explosion radius</h4>
Each explodable has an explosion radius. It's a number of fields in all directions that are affected by an explosion. Explosions affect only fields in vertical and horizontal axis, no diagonals.
Eg. if bomb's explosion radius is 2 and bomb location is [10, 10], then fields affected by explosion would be:
bomb location ([10, 10]), 2 fields Up ([10, 9] and [10, 8]), 2 fields Down ([10, 11] and [10, 12]), 2 fields Left ([9, 10] and [8, 10]) and 2 fields right ([11, 10] and [12, 10])
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
<img src="tank_blaster_blast_example.png"/>
<br/>
Explosion radius can be set separately for bombs and missiles via configuration file. It can also change during gameplay (see Configuration File section)
<h4>Chained explosions</h4>
Each explosion triggers other bombs/missiles withing its radius to explode instantly. There is no limitation to the range or number of chained explosions,
so when placing the bomb user must be aware of other bombs and missiles in the vicinity, that despite not being immediate threat can cause other bombs/missiles to explode prematurely
and kill player before he can get to safety.
<br/>

<br/>

<h3>Bot Moves & Combat</h3>
During each round a bot can move to adjacent empty tile (or stay at current one) and perform one action. There are two types of actions:

<ul>
    <li><b>Drop bomb</b> - a bomb appears on last bot's position (the position of the bot BEFORE move). Bomb explodes after 5 turns</li>
    <li>
        <b>Fire missile</b> - a missile appears on a tile adjacent to bot's new location (the position of the bot AFTER move).
        The exact tile (UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT from bot's location) is calculated based on FireDirection property of bot's move.
        What's more, missile continues moving in that direction at the beginnig of each round with speed 1 tile/round.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Example: At the beginning of the round bot was located at [0,0].
        Than bot decided to move RIGHT and fire DOWN. After the move is executed, bot's location is [1,0] and new missile appears at [1,1].
        If there are any bots left that haven't completed their turns, they do so and the round ends.
        At the beginning of next round (before any bots are asked for their moves) missile moves DOWN, so now the bot's location is [1,0] and missile's is [1,2].
    </li>
</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Game configuration file is named <b>TankBlaster.config.xml</b>. It contains several options that can alter the gameplay:
<ul>
    <li><b>MapWidth</b> - width (in tiles) of the map</li>
    <li><b>MapHeight</b> - height (in tiles) of the map</li>
    <li><b>BombBlastRadius</b>- explosion radius of each bomb (see Explosions section for more information)</li>
    <li><b>MissileBlastRadius</b> - explosion radius of each missile</li>
    <li><b>RoundsBetweenMissiles</b> - time after firing a missile, during which player cannot fire another missile. This is to prevent "missile spamming"</li>
    <li>
        <b>RoundsBeforeIncreasingBlastRadius</b> - this is an additional feature that increases game difficulty.
        Every x rounds bomb and missile explosion radius will increase by 1. This mechanism should prevent bots from playing endlessly by making it harder to avoid explosions.
        Set it to "0" to disable
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>IsFastMissileModeEnabled</b> - if set to "true", missile will explode during the same round that it reaches its last free location. Otherwise it will explode during next round.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Example:</b> Missile is at [10, 10] and moving RIGHT. At [11, 10] there is empty tile, but at [12, 10] there is regular tile. We are at round N. Next round (N+1) begins:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                IsFastMissileModeEnabled option is set to <b>"false"</b>: Missile moves to next tile ([11, 10]). This is an empty tile, so nothing happens and round ends. New round (N+2) begins.
                Missile should move to position [12, 10], but this position is not free. Missile explodes at [11, 10] (during round N+2)
            </li>
            <li>
                IsFastMissileModeEnabled option is set to <b>"true"</b>: Missile moves to next tile ([11, 10]).
                This is an empty tile, but next tile in that direction is not, so missile explodes instantly at [11, 10] (during round N+1)
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementing own bot</h2>
<h3>Bot format and methods</h3>
<h4>Methods</h4>
New bot should be implemented as a web application with 2 methods:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>GET: &lt;bot_url&gt;/Info</b> - a method that won't take any parameters and will return bot information (like Name, AvatarUrl, Description and GameType)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>BotInfo model:</b>
        <pre>
{
    "Name": string,
    "AvatarUrl": string,
    "Description": string,
    "GameType": string
}
</pre>
        GameType should be set to "TankBlaster".
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>POST: &lt;bot_url&gt;/PerformNextMove</b> - a method that takes BattlefieldInfo as a parameter and returns BotMove. This is the method that game will call to ask for bot's next move
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>BattlefieldInfo model:</b>
